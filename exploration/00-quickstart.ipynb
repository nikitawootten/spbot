The goals of NCPS, which \\nalign with the overarching goals of zero trust, are to manage cyber risk, improve cyber protection, and empower partners to secure cyber space. EINSTE IN sensors enable CISA’s \\nNational Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to defend federal networks and respond to significant incidents at federal agencies.  \\nThe placement of NCPS sensors for DHS situational awareness is based on a per imeter network \\ndefense in the Federal Government, while ZTA move s protections closer to the assets, data and \\nall other resources. The NCPS program is evolving to ensure that situational awareness is \\npreserved through utilization of security information about cloud- based traffic , helping to set the \\nfoundation for expanded situational awareness telemetry from ZTA systems. NCPS intrusion prevention functions would also require evolution to be able to inform policy enforcement at both the current NCPS locations  as well as ZTA systems. As ZTA is adopted across the Federal \\nGovernment, the NCPS implementation would need to continually evolve, or new capabilities would need to be deployed to fulfill NCPS objectives. Incident responders could potentially leverage inf ormation from the authentication, traffic inspection, and logging of agency traffic \\navailable to federal agencies that have implemented a zero trust architecture. Information generated in a ZTA may better inform event impact quantification; machine learnin g tools could \\nuse ZTA data to improve detection; and additional logs from ZTA may be saved for after -the-\\nfact analyses by incident responders.  \\n6.6 ZTA and DHS Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) Program  \\nThe DHS CDM program is an effort to improve fede ral agency information technology (IT). \\nVital to that posture is an agency’s insight into the assets, configuration, and subjects within \\nitself. To protect a system, agencies need to set up processes to discover and understand the basic components and acto rs in their infrastructure:  \\n• What is connected?  What devices, applications, and services are used by the \\norganization? This includes observing and improving the security posture of these artifacts as vulnerabilities and threats are discovered.  \\n• Who is using  the network? What users are part of the organization or are external and \\nallowed to access enterprise resources? These include NPEs that may be performing autonomous actions.  \\n• What is happening on the network?  An enterprise needs insight into traffic patte rns \\nand messages between systems.  \\n• How is data protected?  The enterprise needs a set policy on how information is \\nprotected at rest, in transit, and in use. \\nHaving a strong CDM program implementation is key to the success of ZTA. For example, to move to ZTA , an enterprise must have a system to discover and record physical and virtual \\nassets to create a usable inventory. The DHS CDM program has initiated several efforts to build the capabilities needed within federal agencies to move to a ZTA.

Zero trust architecture is an end -to-\\nend approach to enterprise resource and data security that encompasses identity (person and non-\\nperson entities), credentials, access management, operations, endpoints, hosting environments, and the interconnecting infrastructure. The initial focus should be on restricting resources to \\nthose with a need to access and grant only the minimum privileges (e.g., read, write, delete) \\nneeded to perform the mission. Traditionally, agencies (and enterprise networks in general) have \\nfocused on perimeter defense and authenticated subjects are given authorized access to a broad collection of resources once on the internal network. As a result, unauthorized lateral movement within the environment  has been one of the biggest challenges for federal agencies.  \\nThe Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) and agency perimeter firewalls pr ovide strong internet \\ngateways. This helps block attackers from the internet, but the TICs and perimeter firewalls are less useful for detecting and blocking attacks from inside the network and cannot protect subjects outside of the enterprise perimeter (e .g., remote workers, cloud- based services, edge devices, \\netc.).  \\nAn operative definition of zero trust and zero trust architecture is as follows: \\nZero t rust (ZT) provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize \\nuncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per -request access decisions in \\ninformation systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. Zero trust architectu re (ZTA) is an enterprise’s cybersecurity plan that utilizes zero trust \\nconcepts and encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies . Therefore, a zero trust enterprise  is the network infrastructure (physical and \\nvirtual) and op erational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a zero \\ntrust architecture plan.  \\nAn enterprise decides to adopt zero trust as its core strategy  and generate a zero trust architecture \\nas a plan developed with zero trust principles (see  Section 2.1  below) in mind. This plan is then \\ndeployed to produce a zero trust environment for use in the enterprise.   \\nThis definition focuses on the crux of the i ssue, which is the goal to prevent unauthorized access \\nto data and services  coupled with making the access control enforcement as granular a s \\npossible . That is, authorized and approved subjects (combination of user, application (or service), \\nand device) ca n access the data to the exclusion of all other subjects (i.e., attackers). To take this \\none step further, the word “resource” can be substituted for “data” so that ZT and ZTA are about resource access (e.g., printers, compute resources, Internet of Things [IoT] actuators) and not just data access.  \\nTo lessen uncertainties (as they cannot be eliminated), the focus is on authentication, authorization, and shrinking implicit trust zones while maintaining availability and minimizing temporal delays in authentication mechanisms. Access rules are made as granular as possible to \\nenforce least privileges needed to perform the action in the request .', metadata={'source': 'https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf', 'page': 12})]"

Access is granted through a policy decision point (PDP) and corresponding policy enforcement point (PEP).\\n3  \\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Zero Trust Access  \\nThe system must ensure that the subject is authentic and the request is valid. The PDP/PEP passes proper judgment to allow the subject to access the resource. This implies that zero trust applies to two basic areas: authentication and authorization. What is the level of confidence about the subject’s identity for this unique request? Is access to the resource al lowable given the \\nlevel of confidence in the subject’s identity? Does the device used for the request have the proper security posture? Are there other factors that should be considered and that change the confidence level (e.g., time, location of subject, subject’s security posture)? Overall, enterprises need to develop and maintain dynamic risk- based policies for resource access and set up a \\nsystem to ensure that these policies are enforced correctly and consistently for individual resource access request s. This means that an enterprise should not rely on implied \\ntrustworthiness wherein if the subject has met a base authentication level (e.g., logging into an asset), all subsequent resource requests are assumed to be equally valid .  \\nThe “implicit trust zon e” represents an area where all the entities are trusted to at least the level \\nof the last PDP/PEP gateway. For example, consider the passenger screening model in an airport. All passengers pass through the airport security checkpoint (PDP/PEP) to access t he boarding \\ngates. The passengers, airport employees, aircraft crew, etc. , mill about in the terminal area, and \\nall the individuals are considered trusted. In this model, the implicit trust zone is the boarding \\narea.  \\nThe PDP/PEP applies a set of controls so that all traffic beyond the PEP has a common level of trust. The PDP/PEP cannot apply additional policies beyond its location in the flow of traffic. To allow the PDP/PEP to be as specific as possible, the implicit trust zone must be as small as possible.  \\nZero trust provides a set of principles and concepts around moving the PDP/PEPs  closer to the \\nresource. The idea is to explicitly authenticate and authorize all subjects, assets and workflows \\nthat make up the enterprise.  \\n \\n3 Part of the concepts defined in OASIS XACML 2.0 https://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/2.0/access_control-xacml -2.0-core-spec -\\nos.pdf', metadata={'source': 'https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

It is assumed that most automated technology systems will use some \\nmeans to authenticate when using an API to resource components.   \\nThe biggest risk when using automated technology for configuration and policy enforcement is the possibility of false positives (innocuous actions mistaken for attacks) and false negatives (attacks mistaken for normal activity) impacting the security posture of the enterprise. This can \\nbe reduced with regular retuning analysis to correct mistaken decisions and improve the decision process.  \\nThe associated risk is that an attacker will be able to  induce or coerce an NPE to perform some \\ntask that the attacker is not privileged to perform. The software agent may have a lower bar for authentication (e.g., API key versus MFA) to perform administrative or security -related tasks \\ncompared with a human us er. If an attacker can interact with the agent, they could theoretically \\ntrick the agent into allowing the attacker greater access or into performing some task on behalf of the attacker. There is also a risk that an attacker could gain access to a software agent’s credentials and impersonate the agent when performing tasks.', metadata={'source': 'https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",

The policy engine, policy ad ministrator, and PEPs use the \\ncontrol plane to communicate and manage communication paths between assets. The \\nPEPs must be able to send and receive messages from both the data and control planes.  \\n6. Enterprise assets can reach the PEP component.

      "The document \"NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture\" provides a framework for protecting enterprise resources and data by assuming that all access to resources is untrusted, regardless of the user's location or device. The zero trust architecture focuses on restricting resource access to only those with a legitimate need to access them, and granting access only to the minimum privileges required to perform the intended action. The document provides guidelines for implementing a zero trust architecture, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Understanding the basics of zero trust and its importance in protecting enterprise resources.\n",
      "2. Identifying the key components of a zero trust architecture, including the policy engine, policy administrator, and the underlying infrastructure.\n",
      "3. Discussing the potential threats to a zero trust architecture, such as unauthorized access, network disruptions, and denial-of-service attacks.\n",
      "4. Providing recommendations for mitigating these threats, including proper configuration and monitoring of the policy engine and policy administrator, as well as replication of the policy enforcement in a secure cloud environment.\n",
      "5. Emphasizing the importance of evaluating the zero trust architecture regularly to ensure its effectiveness in protecting enterprise resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing a zero trust architecture in an enterprise network, focusing on resource protection and the minimization of implicit trust zones.\n"
